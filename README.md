# genome_assembly

A customized 3D genome *de novo* assembly protocol based on the powerful tools designed by [Aiden Lab](https://github.com/theaidenlab). Two softwares are employed, [1] [juicer](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer) and [2] [3d-dna](https://github.com/theaidenlab/3d-dna), to complete the *de novo* assembly project. Althogh there are comprehensive descriptions about the two tools, some problems may occur when you are preparing the input files and the single computing node executing the the scripts. We devote to simplify the computing progress, therefore this customized protocol is extremely friendly to naive operators who is not very familiar to bioinformatics.

### Why juicer and 3d-dna?
3d-dna is an amazing tool, which can correct the misassembly of the initial draft assembly to end-to-end assembly by iterative scaffording and overlap merging (more details are shown in the paper: [De novo assembly of the Aedes aegypti genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/03/22/science.aal3327.full)). The juicer is used for creating merged and deduplicated genome files (* .merged_nodups.txt) which is one of the input files for 3d-dna, also it is called one-click system for analyzing loop-resolution Hi-C experiments (more details are shown in the paper: [Juicer Provides a One-Click System for Analyzing Loop-Resolution Hi-C Experiments](http://www.cell.com/cell-systems/abstract/S2405-4712(16)30219-8)).
